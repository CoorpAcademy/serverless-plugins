      - sqs: arn:aws:sqs:region:XXXXXX:MyFirstQueue
      - sqs:
          arn: arn:aws:sqs:region:XXXXXX:MySecondQueue

              - MyThirdQueue
              - Arn

  Resources:
    MyFourthQueue:
      Type: AWS::SQS::Queue

```

### SQS

The configuration of [`aws.SQS`'s client](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/SQS.html#constructor-property) of the plugin is done by defining a `custom: serverless-offline-sqs` object in your `serverless.yml` with your specific configuration.

You could use [ElasticMQ](https://github.com/adamw/elasticmq) with the following configuration:

```yml
custom:
  serverless-offline-sqs:
    apiVersion: '2012-11-05'
    endpoint: http://0.0.0.0:9324
    region: eu-west-1
    accessKeyId: root
    secretAccessKey: root
    skipCacheInvalidation: false
```
